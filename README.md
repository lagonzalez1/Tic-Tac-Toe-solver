Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm
This is a simple Python implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against a bot that uses the Minimax algorithm. The bot is designed to minimize its chances of losing and maximize its chances of winning. As a result, the game will most likely end in a tie unless you make a mistake.

Features:
Player X (Human) makes a move by selecting a row and column.
Player O (Bot) uses the Minimax algorithm to choose its move, ensuring optimal play.
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with positions displayed for easy move selection.
The bot will not make mistakes, so the game usually results in a tie unless you lose by making suboptimal moves.

How the Minimax Algorithm Works:
The Minimax algorithm evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that minimizes the chances of losing while maximizing the chances of winning. This makes the bot almost unbeatable unless the human player makes an error.
